#BackMeUp
BackMeUp is a program I developed in Python and compiled into a .EXE file that backs up folders. It makes backing up easier and faster. It is currently a work in progress (WIP).

#Usage:
When you first open BackMeUp, you will be prompted to enter a valid working directory that is part of your main computer files. Once inside, you will see all the files and folders in the directory.

Find a folder to back up. A folder looks like this: "(folder name)". As you can tell, it does not have a file extension such as .exe or .txt.

Simply enter the folder name exactly as it appears, and it will back up the folder in the same directory. The backup folder will have the same name as the original folder but with _backup added at the end.

If the backup folder already exists, you will be asked if you want to overwrite it. If you have used BackMeUp to back up a folder and it has been updated since the last backup, you can use the overwrite feature to apply the new files.

If you want to exit the program while it is running, you may press the CTRL + C keyboard combination to exit the program successfully.
#Additional Notes
All files are currently a work in progress.
