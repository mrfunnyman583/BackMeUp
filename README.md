BackMeUp:
is a program I developed in Python and compiled into a .EXE file that backs up folders. It makes backing up easier and faster. The program is currently a work in progress (WIP).

Usage:
When you first open BackMeUp, you will be prompted to enter a valid working directory that is part of your main computer files. Once inside, you will see all the files and folders in that directory.

Find a folder to back up. A folder looks like this: "(folder name)". As you can see, it does not have a file extension such as .exe or .txt.

Simply enter the folder name exactly as it appears, and the program will back up the folder in the same directory. The backup folder will have the same name as the original folder but with "_backup" added at the end.

If the backup folder already exists, you will be asked whether you want to overwrite it. If you have used BackMeUp before and the folder has been updated since the last backup, you can use the overwrite option to apply the new files.

To exit the program while it is running, press the CTRL + C keyboard combination to close it successfully.

Additional Notes:
All files are currently a work in progress.
